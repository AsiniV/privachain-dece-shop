# PrivaChain Decentral - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: A privacy-focused, decentralized web browser that seamlessly runs complex modern web applications while providing secure access to decentralized content and encrypted communications.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can access any modern web application (Figma, YouTube, Google, etc.) without functionality limitations
- Seamless switching between traditional web and decentralized content (IPFS, .prv domains)
- Secure messaging with end-to-end encryption
- Comprehensive privacy monitoring and protection

**Experience Qualities**: Powerful, Secure, Seamless

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, state management, cross-protocol support)
**Primary User Activity**: Acting & Creating (browsing, communicating, managing privacy)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Traditional browsers lack privacy controls and decentralized content access, while privacy tools often sacrifice functionality. Users need a single interface that provides full web compatibility with enhanced privacy and decentralized capabilities.

**User Context**: Privacy-conscious users, blockchain developers, and anyone wanting unrestricted web access with security. Used for daily browsing, development work, and secure communications.

**Critical Path**: Open browser → Navigate to any website (traditional or decentralized) → Full functionality preserved → Optional secure messaging and privacy controls

**Key Moments**: 
1. First navigation to complex web app (proves capability)
2. Seamless transition between traditional and decentralized content
3. Real-time privacy monitoring during browsing

- **Success Criteria**: Tab state survives app restarts, proper back/forward navigation

### Secure Messenger Integration
- **What**: End-to-end encrypted messaging system accessible within browser interface
- **Why**: Provides secure communication without leaving the privacy-focused environment
- **Success Criteria**: Messages encrypted, reliable delivery, integration with browser interface

### Privacy Dashboard & Monitoring
- **What**: Real-time privacy analytics, tracker blocking, and security status
- **Why**: Users need visibility into privacy protection and potential threats
- **Success Criteria**: Clear privacy metrics, actionable security recommendations

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Trust, capability, sophistication
**Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable, cutting-edge without being intimidating
**Visual Metaphors**: Network connections, shields, digital privacy
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface with advanced features progressively disclosed

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent highlights
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.6 0.2 240)) - represents trust and technology
**Secondary Colors**: Darker blues and grays for depth and professionalism
**Accent Color**: Bright green (oklch(0.75 0.15 130)) - indicates security and success
**Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, green represents security and go-ahead actions
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: High contrast ratios maintained throughout for accessibility

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI (clean, readable) and JetBrains Mono for technical content
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between navigation, content, and technical information
**Font Personality**: Modern, clean, trustworthy
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing and sizing across all interface elements

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Top navigation → address bar → content area → optional side panels
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and emphasize content
**Grid System**: Flexible layout adapting to different content types and screen sizes
**Content Density**: Balanced - sufficient information without overwhelming

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle loading animations, smooth transitions between views
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading states and navigation transitions take priority
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, purposeful motion that doesn't distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: shadcn components for consistency - Buttons, Cards, Badges, Progress bars
**Component Customization**: Dark theme with blue/green accent colors
**Component States**: Clear hover, active, and loading states for all interactive elements
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency and clarity
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's spacing scale for consistent rhythm

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**: 
- CORS restrictions limiting website functionality
- Cross-origin security policies affecting iframe behavior
- Complex web apps requiring specific browser features

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Comprehensive iframe sandbox permissions for maximum compatibility
- Fallback loading strategies for restricted content
- Clear error messaging with recovery options

**Technical Constraints**: 
- Browser security limitations for cross-origin content
- Performance considerations for multiple complex tabs
- Storage limitations for persistent state

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Efficient tab management, content caching, and state persistence
**Testing Focus**: Complex web application compatibility, privacy feature effectiveness
**Critical Questions**: 
- How well do complex applications perform in iframe environment?
- What privacy features provide genuine protection without breaking functionality?
- How can we maintain security while maximizing compatibility?

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines unrestricted web access with decentralized capabilities and privacy protection. Unlike existing privacy browsers that often sacrifice functionality, PrivaChain maintains full compatibility while adding enhanced security and decentralized features. The challenge is balancing maximum functionality with genuine privacy protection.
