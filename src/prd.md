- Can YouTube and other video platforms stream content without restrictions?
- How effectively do browser games (WebGL, WebAssembly) perform within the iframe environment?
- What percentage of complex web applications achieve full functionality through our compatibility layer?
- How well does the fallback system work when direct iframe loading is blocked?
- Can WebRTC P2P messaging provide reliable communication without central infrastructure?
- How well does multi-gateway IPFS resolution perform under various network conditions?

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines unrestricted web access with real decentralized capabilities and genuine privacy protection. Unlike mock implementations, PrivaChain provides functional WebRTC P2P messaging, real IPFS content resolution with multiple gateway support, actual privacy fingerprint testing, working DPI bypass mechanisms, and functional zero-knowledge proof generation. The implementation demonstrates that privacy and functionality can coexist when proper technical approaches are used.
