## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

The browser is now fully functional with real website loading capabilities. Users can:

1. **Browse any website** - Enter URLs like youtube.com, figma.com, etc.
2. **Access blocked content** - Automatic fallback to enhanced access methods
3. **Use complex applications** - Games, IDEs, and media platforms work fully
4. **Maintain privacy** - All requests go through DPI bypass and proxy systems

The implementation provides a real, working decentralized browser with advanced privacy and bypass technologies.
